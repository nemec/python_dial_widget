Dial Widget 1.0

Introduction:
=============
This widget displays a simple dial that can be clicked on and dragged to increase
or decrease the value of the dial. It emits increase/decrease events at specified
intervals as well as an event every time the dial moves.

The image file provided when initializing the widget will rotate with the dial.

The dial has a barrier between 0 and 360 degrees (calculated from the left
horizontal upwards). Once the dial is rotated 360 degrees, it will not rotate any
more and must be rotated back to zero the long way (this prevents instant jumps
from zero to the ticker's maximum value)

Dependencies:
=============
  Python GTK 2.0 (pygtk): (Obviously, this widget will only work on platforms with Gnome installed)
  Python Imaging Library: Currently available at http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
  Numerical Python Library (python-numpy): Available at http://numpy.scipy.org/
  GIbject Module (python-gobject)

Instructions:
=============
The dial is initialized with two optional arguments:
  image_file - Defaults to dial.png, this is the image that is displayed
  ticker_max - Defaults to 100 (for percentages), determines the maximum value
    that the ticker will report as well as how often the "increase" and "decrease"
    events are reported.

Three events can be connected to:
  dial_changed - This event is emitted every time the dial moves. It returns a
    floating point value between 0 and ticker_max, calculated with the following
    formula: angle_rotated*ticker_max/360. The angle is calculated from the left
    horizontal upwards.
  dial_increase - This event is emitted every time dial_changed, rounded to the
    nearest integer, increases. It has no returned value.
  dial_decrease - This event is emitted every time dial_changed, rounded to the
    nearest integer, decreases. It has no returned value.
